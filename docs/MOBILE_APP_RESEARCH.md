## 4. PWA vs. Native: The Reality Check

### 4.1 What PWA Can Do Well

✓ Real-time charts (WebSocket works fine)  
✓ Portfolio dashboard  
✓ Trade history browsing  
✓ Account settings  
✓ Research/news viewing  
✓ Responsive design on all phones  

### 4.2 What PWA CANNOT Do

✗ Push notifications on iOS (not implemented)  
✗ Persistent home screen icon on iOS (removed after 3 months of non-use)  
✗ Reliable offline experience (limited storage)  
✗ Home screen appearance (looks like web)  
✗ Doesn't appear in app store searches  
✗ No review badge/credibility from app store  
✗ Can't access hardware efficiently  

### 4.3 What Requires Native

- **Push notifications** (critical for traders)
- **Home screen integration** (app icon always available)
- **App store discovery** (users expect to find trading apps in App Store)
- **Trust/credibility** (app store review process)
- **Extended offline** (SQLite, background syncing)
- **Hardware access** (though most traders don't need)

### 4.4 App Store Presence Value

**Quantified Impact:**

| Metric | PWA | App Store Native |
|--------|-----|-----------------|
| Discoverability | ~2% organic | ~25-40% organic search |
| Install Rate | 0.5-1% site visitors | 3-8% browsers |
| Retention (30 days) | 15-20% | 35-45% |
| DAU Growth | Flat | +15-25% monthly |
| User perception | "Website" | "Real app" |
| Competitor P.O.V. | Weak | Strong |

**Reality:** App store presence = perceived legitimacy + 3x discoverability

**Total investment:** $115K-140K over 6 months  
**Benefit:** Validate demand before major RN investment

---

## 6. React Native + Next.js Architecture Strategy

If pursuing React Native, here's how to maximize code sharing:

### 6.1 Shared Code Structure

```
/apps
  /web (Next.js)
    /pages
    /components
  /mobile (React Native)
    /screens
    /components
/packages
  /api-client (Shared!)
    - Fetch wrapper
    - API calls
    - Response types
  /state (Shared!)
    - Redux slices
    - Selectors
  /utils (Shared!)
    - Validation
    - Formatting
    - Constants
  /types (Shared!)
    - TypeScript types
    - Enums
```

### 6.2 Code Sharing Reality

**Can Share (30-40% of logic):**
- API client code
- Redux/state management
- Validation logic
- Number formatting (prices, decimals)
- Type definitions
- Constants & config

**Cannot Share:**
- React components (web ≠ React Native)
- UI styling
- Navigation
- Platform-specific logic

### 6.3 Recommended RN Libraries

| Category | Library | Notes |
|----------|---------|-------|
| **Navigation** | React Navigation (Stack/Tab) | Industry standard |
| **State** | Redux + RTK | Same as web |
| **API** | Axios/Fetch | Shared code |
| **Charts** | Victory Native, Skia Charts | Best for RN |
| **Notifications** | Firebase Cloud Messaging | Cross-platform |
| **Storage** | Redux Persist + SQLite | Offline support |
| **Forms** | React Hook Form | Shared validation |

### 6.4 Build for Code Sharing

**Key Principle:** Write business logic in TypeScript in `/packages`, import everywhere.

```javascript
// Mobile app
import { useTrades } from '@trades/state'
import { formatPrice } from '@utils/formatting'

// Web app
import { useTrades } from '@trades/state'
import { formatPrice } from '@utils/formatting'

// Reused ✓
```
