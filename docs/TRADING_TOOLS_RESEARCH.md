---

## Technical Architecture Notes

### **Data Pipeline**
- Use job queue (Celery/BullMQ) for recurring data updates
- Cache heavily: IV calculations, Greeks, correlations (5-15 min expiry)
- Broker API integrations: Interactive Brokers, Alpaca, Webull (for real-time prices)
- Backup free data sources (if primary API down, fall back to secondary)

### **Real-Time Considerations**
- Most "real-time" tools can be 15-30 min delayed free data
- Only pay for true real-time for: price alerts, options flow, liquidations
- WebSocket connections for live updates (Finnhub, Binance, etc.)

### **Scalability**
- Start with PostgreSQL + Redis (cache, queues)
- Partition screener jobs (run on multiple workers to handle all symbols)
- Use horizontal scaling for APIs (multiple instances behind load balancer)

---

## Competitive Positioning

### **Why ChartGenius Can Win:**

| Tool | TradingView | ThinkOrSwim | ChartGenius Angle |
|------|-------------|------------|-------------------|
| Calculators | Premium feature | Built-in | **Free, elegant, fast** |
| Screeners | Good but paid | Excellent, free | **Combine technical + fundamental** |
| Greeks | Yes (paid) | Yes (free) | **Interactive sliders, sensitivity** |
| Strategy Builder | Limited | Excellent | **Visual builder, probability bands** |
| Trading Journal | No | No | **Community sharing, AI reviews** |
| Correlation Matrix | Limited | No | **Multi-asset, cross-market** |
| Sentiment | Paid feature | No | **Free, real-time, contrarian alerts** |

**Key differentiation:** ChartGenius is the "Swiss Army knife" for traders. We're not trying to be TradingView (too expensive, bloated). We're being the essential calculators and analysis tools traders actually use daily, across all asset classes.

---

- ✅ 1,000+ monthly active users
- ✅ 10,000+ daily calculator uses

## Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-----------|
| Free data APIs get restricted | High | Build redundancy; always have backup APIs |
| Market downturn → lower trading volume | High | Broaden to non-traders (portfolio tracking, education) |
| Competitors copy tools faster | Medium | Differentiate with UX, community, accuracy |
| Data quality issues → wrong advice | High | Validate all data sources; daily sanity checks; disclaim as education |
| Options/crypto regulation changes | Medium | Modular architecture; quickly deprecate restricted features |
| Real-time data costs spiral | Medium | Start with delayed data; only upgrade if monetization justifies it |

---

## Final Recommendation

**START HERE (Phase 1):**

1. ✅ **Risk/Reward Calculator** - Ship this FIRST (1 day)
2. ✅ **Position Size Calculator** - Ship next (1 day)
3. ✅ **Options P&L Calculator** - Ship day 3-4
4. ✅ **Enhanced Economic Calendar** - Iterate on existing

These 4 tools will take 1 week to ship, provide immediate value, and establish ChartGenius as "the trader's essential toolkit."

**Then move to Phase 2:** Greeks + Screener + IV Rank (weeks 2-3)

**After 4 weeks, you'll have:** The 10 most essential tools that 80% of traders use daily. That's your MVP. Then iterate based on user feedback.

**Avoid the trap:** Don't try to build everything. Start simple, ship fast, iterate based on actual user demand. The tools that get used become revenue; the ones that don't, you can deprecate.

---

**Report Completed:** March 8, 2026  
**Recommended Start Date:** Immediately  
**Estimated Timeline to MVP (Phase 1):** 4-6 weeks with 2-3 developers
