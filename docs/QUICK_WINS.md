1. Dark Mode Toggle (#1)
2. Export Watchlist (#3)
3. Watchlist Quick-Add Shortcut (#7)

7. Earnings Surprise Alert (#4)
8. Pre-Market Movers (#13)
9. Volume Leaders (#15)

## Resource Requirements

- **Time:** 10–15 engineer-days total
- **Skills:** React/Next.js, TailwindCSS, state management, chart libraries
- **Dependencies:** New design tokens (dark mode)

### QA & Release

## Competitive Gaps Addressed

| Gap | Feature(s) Solving | Competitor |
|-----|-------------------|-----------|
| No dark mode | Dark Mode (#1) | TradingView, Benzinga |
| No chart sharing | Share Snapshots (#5) | TradingView (strong here) |
| Limited earnings data | Earnings Surprise (#4) | TradingView, Benzinga |
| No market digest | Daily Email (#6) | Yahoo Finance, Benzinga |
| Slow watchlist mgmt | Bulk Actions (#14) | FinViz |
| No social engagement | Leaderboard (#9), Share Links (#18) | StockTwits (community) |

---

## Risk & Mitigation

| Risk | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|-----------|
| Dark mode breaks charts | Medium | Test all chart types (candlestick, volume, indicators) |
| Email deliverability issues | Low | Use SendGrid template; test with multiple providers |
| API rate limit exceeded (movers, earnings data) | Medium | Implement caching (1h TTL); fallback to cached data |
| Share links expose user preferences | Low | Permission checks; option to anonymize |
| Scheduler job misses time zones | Low | Store user TZ in DB; use `moment-timezone` for accuracy |

---

## Notes for Product

- **User Research:** Test heatmap + comparison features in beta. Early feedback will inform iteration.
- **Mobile App:** Features #12, #17 depend on React Native roadmap. Can ship responsive web versions first.
- **Data Quality:** Earnings surprise, dividend alerts only work if Alpha Vantage/Finnhub data is accurate. Monitor API quality.
- **Community:** Leaderboard & share links create engagement loops. Monitor for abuse (market manipulation signals).
