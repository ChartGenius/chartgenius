**Version:** 1.0  
**Last Updated:** March 6, 2026  
**Maintained By:** Support Team (Erick, Bolt)  
**Status:** Active

---

## 1. Common Issues & Responses

### Issue: Can't Log In

**Symptoms:**
- Authentication failure / "Invalid credentials"
- Password reset emails not arriving
- Account locked after multiple attempts
- "Database connection error" on login

**Root Causes:**
- Incorrect email/password
- Email verification not completed
- Render backend temporarily down
- Browser cache/cookies issue
- Account not yet provisioned

**Troubleshooting Steps:**
1. Verify email address is correct (case-insensitive)
2. Try password reset → check spam/promotions folder
3. Clear browser cache and cookies, try incognito/private mode
4. Confirm email was verified (check signup confirmation email)
5. Check [status page] for backend availability
6. Try a different browser if issue persists

**Workaround:**
- If reset email not received after 5 mins: have user check spam folder, then resend
- If still failing: escalate to Erick for manual database check

---

### Issue: Data Not Loading

**Symptoms:**
- Dashboard shows empty charts
- Watchlist items load but no prices
- "Loading..." spinner stuck > 10 seconds
- 500 error or network timeout

**Root Causes:**
- Render backend stalled/crashed
- Finnhub API quota exceeded
- Supabase connection timeout
- Browser JavaScript error (broken state)
- Very large watchlist (>1000 items)

**Troubleshooting Steps:**
1. Check internet connection (ping a known site)
2. Hard refresh: `Ctrl+Shift+R` (Windows) or `Cmd+Shift+R` (Mac)
3. Log out and log back in
4. Clear local storage: open DevTools → Application → Local Storage → Clear all
5. Check [status page] for known outages
6. Try with a smaller watchlist (remove 100+ items)
7. If error persists, share browser console error (Ctrl+Shift+J)

**Workaround:**
- If a specific watchlist causes hang: temporarily remove problematic symbols
- Can export data if needed while investigating

---

### Issue: Alerts Not Working

**Symptoms:**
- Alert created but no notification received
- Price hits threshold but no alert triggered
- "Alert set" indicator missing
- Browser notifications disabled

**Root Causes:**
- Browser notification permissions denied
- Alert syntax error (invalid symbol, bad threshold)
- Real-time data feed delay
- Alert deleted/expired
- Notification channel misconfigured
- User dismissed notification center access

**Troubleshooting Steps:**
1. Verify browser notifications enabled:
   - Settings → Privacy & Security → Notifications → TradVue ✓
2. Check alert details:
   - Is the symbol correct? (AAPL not Apple)
   - Is threshold realistic? (not $0.01 below current price)
3. Test with a nearby price trigger first (within 2%)
4. Check Settings → Notifications:
   - Email alerts turned on?
   - Push enabled?
   - Quiet hours set too wide?
5. Try creating a new alert from scratch
6. Refresh dashboard and re-enable notifications

**Workaround:**
- Use email alerts as backup if push not working
- Pin alert to Always Show in browser
- Known issue: delays up to 2-5 min on some news sources (by design)

---

### Issue: App is Slow / High Latency

**Symptoms:**
- Page takes 5+ seconds to load
- Clicking buttons has 2+ second delay
- Charts render slowly
- Network requests taking >3s

**Root Causes:**
- Render backend overloaded
- Finnhub API slow response
- Browser running too many tabs (memory leak)
- Very large dataset (10k+ prices in one watchlist)
- User's ISP/network issue
- Supabase query timeout

**Troubleshooting Steps:**
1. Check network tab (DevTools → Network):
   - Which requests are slow? (API, assets, images?)
2. Reduce watchlist size temporarily:
   - Archive older watchlists, keep active ones only
3. Check browser memory:
   - DevTools → Performance → take heap snapshot
   - Look for abnormal data structures
4. Restart browser (clear memory)
5. Switch networks (WiFi ↔ mobile hotspot)
6. Check time of day — if ~3pm EST, market peak might cause spikes

**Workaround:**
- Limit watchlists to <500 items per list
- Close unused tabs
- Use incognito mode (tests if extensions are culprit)
- Check [status page] — may be planned maintenance

---

### Issue: Feature Requests

**Symptoms:**
- User wants X feature
- Missing functionality in UI
- Workflow requires multiple steps

**Examples Received:**
- Mobile app (known, Q2 2026)
- Google Calendar sync (launching next week)
- TradingView integration
- Discord/Slack alerts
- More data sources (Crypto options, futures, forex edge cases)

**Response:**
1. Acknowledge the request with specific language:
   - "Great idea — this would [benefit]...."
   - Link to public roadmap if relevant
2. Ask for context:
   - How often would you use this?
   - Would this replace an existing workflow or add new one?
   - Any specific use case?
3. Log it: Add to `/docs/PRODUCT_ROADMAP.md` under "Community Requests"
4. Set expectation:
   - If in roadmap: estimated timeline
   - If not yet discussed: will review in next sprint
5. Offer workaround if available

**Note:** Prioritize requests that 2+ beta users mention independently.

---

### Issue: Bug Reports

**Symptoms:**
- UI doesn't match expected behavior
- Incorrect data displayed
- Visual glitches
- API returns wrong values
- Feature partially broken

**Response Protocol:**
1. **Immediate response** (< 5 min):
   - Acknowledge receipt
   - Ask for reproduction steps
   - Request screenshot/video if visual
2. **Triage** (within 30 min):
   - Can you reproduce it?
   - Is it blocking? (P0-P3)
   - Frontend vs backend issue?
3. **Log it**:
   - Title: "Bug: [Component] [Symptom]"
   - Add to GitHub Issues with reproduction steps
   - Tag with `[BUG]` and priority
4. **Keep user updated**:
   - Daily progress update if P0
   - Every 48h if P1/P2
   - Weekly if P3

**Example:**
- **P0 (Critical):** Can't log in at all → immediate Slack to Erick
- **P1 (High):** Alerts not triggering → 4-hour response time
- **P2 (Medium):** Chart color rendering wrong → 24-hour response time
- **P3 (Low):** UI spacing looks off → can wait for next sprint

## 3. Escalation Matrix

### When to Escalate to Erick (Backend/Database)

**Escalate immediately if:**
- User can't log in and reset email isn't working
- Account data missing or corrupted
- Database query errors in logs
- Authentication failing for subset of users
- Data not persisting (watchlists, alerts disappear)
- API returning 500 errors consistently

**Slack format:**
```
@Erick — Can you check [USER EMAIL]'s account?

Issue: [SYMPTOM]
Steps taken: [TROUBLESHOOTING]
Error log: [PASTE LOG]

User says it started [WHEN]. Blocking them from [WHAT].
```

**Response time:** < 30 minutes for P0, < 2 hours for P1

---

### When to Escalate to Bolt (Frontend/Deployment)

**Escalate immediately if:**
- Frontend not loading (white screen, JS error)
- Deployment broken (site down for >5% of users)
- Build failed on Vercel
- CSS/UI completely broken
- Browser compatibility issue (only on Safari, Firefox, etc.)
- Performance degraded significantly

**Slack format:**
```
@Bolt — Frontend issue needs your eyes.

Issue: [SYMPTOM]
Affected: [SAFARI / CHROME / ALL BROWSERS]
Reproduction: [EXACT STEPS]
Error: [CONSOLE ERROR]
Environment: [STAGING / PROD]

Started: [WHEN]. Affects [HOW MANY USERS].
```

**Response time:** < 30 minutes for P0, < 1 hour for P1

---

### Priority Levels (P0-P3)

| Level | Definition | Response Time | Resolution Time |
|-------|-----------|---|---|
| **P0 (Critical)** | Service down for multiple users OR blocks core workflow (login, alerts, data access) | **15 min** | **2 hours** |
| **P1 (High)** | Feature partially broken, workaround exists, affects 1-5 users | **1 hour** | **24 hours** |
| **P2 (Medium)** | Minor feature issue, cosmetic glitch, single user impact | **4 hours** | **3 days** |
| **P3 (Low)** | Enhancement idea, UI polish, no impact on functionality | **Next business day** | **Next sprint** |

**How to decide:**
- Can the user still trade? → P2 or higher
- Is it a widespread outage? → P0
- Does it affect login? → P0
- Is there a workaround? → Drop priority by 1 level
- Only one user? → P2 max (unless blocking critical path)

---

### Response Time Targets (SLA)

**Acknowledgment:**
- P0: 5 minutes
- P1: 30 minutes
- P2: 2 hours
- P3: Next business day

**Update (if not resolved):**
- P0: Every 30 minutes
- P1: Every 2 hours
- P2: Daily
- P3: Every 3 days or end of sprint

**Status:** In Progress (ETA: March 12, 2026)

**Description:**
- Sporadic authentication failures during peak hours (2-4pm EST)
- Caused by connection pool exhaustion (occurred on Railway prior to Render migration)
- Affects ~2-3% of login attempts

**Symptoms:**
- "Database connection timeout" error on login
- User can retry 1-2 minutes later and succeed
- Not user account specific

**Workaround:**
- Retry login after 1-2 minutes
- Use different browser if immediate access needed

**Tracking:** GitHub Issue #47 (historical — resolved via Render migration)

---

### Issue 2: Mobile Responsiveness on Tablets

**Status:** Known, Low Priority (no estimated fix)

**Description:**
- iPad landscape mode has layout issues
- Some buttons cut off on smaller screens
