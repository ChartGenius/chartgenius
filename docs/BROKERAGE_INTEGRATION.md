# Brokerage Integration Research for ChartGenius

**Document Date:** March 2026  
**Status:** Research & Planning (Pre-MVP)  
**Purpose:** Evaluate brokerage integration options for future ChartGenius features

---

## Executive Summary

This document evaluates six major brokerages for potential API integration with ChartGenius, a charting and trading analytics platform. The analysis covers API capabilities, authentication methods, regulatory requirements, and recommendations for MVP implementation.

**Key Finding:** Alpaca and Tradier are best positioned for MVP integration due to superior API documentation, OAuth2 support, and transparent rate limits. TD Ameritrade/Schwab integration is possible but requires partnership with Schwab. E*TRADE and Interactive Brokers offer comprehensive features but with steeper compliance complexity.

## 3. ENABLING FEATURES FOR CHARTGENIUS

### 3.1 Position Import to Watchlist
**Difficulty:** Easy-Medium  
**Prerequisites:** Read-only account access, OAuth2 or API key

**Implementation Path:**
1. Authenticate user via OAuth2 flow
2. Fetch `/accounts/{id}/positions` endpoint
3. Parse holdings into watchlist format
4. Store symbol, shares, entry price, current value
5. Sync on-demand or scheduled (e.g., daily)

**Brokers Best Suited:** Alpaca, Schwab, Tradier (best documentation)

**Timeline:** 1-2 weeks per broker

---

### 3.2 P&L Dashboard Integration
**Difficulty:** Easy  
**Prerequisites:** Position history, real-time quotes

**Implementation Path:**
1. Calculate unrealized P&L from positions + current quotes
2. Fetch order history for trades with entry prices
3. Calculate realized P&L from closed positions
4. Display portfolio metrics: total return %, daily change, etc.
5. Aggregate across broker accounts if multi-broker

**Brokers Best Suited:** All major brokers support this

**Data Sources:**
- Positions endpoint → Current holdings
- Orders endpoint → Trade history
- Quotes API → Real-time/delayed pricing

**Timeline:** 2-3 weeks integration + testing

---

### 3.3 One-Click Trade from ChartGenius
**Difficulty:** Medium-Hard  
**Prerequisites:** Trading API access, OAuth2 with trading scopes

**Security Considerations:** ⚠️ HIGH RISK
- Requires write access to user accounts
- Must implement order preview/confirmation UI
- Consider 2FA for sensitive operations
- Need clear risk disclaimers

**Implementation Path:**
1. Authenticate with `trading` scope in OAuth2
2. Build order builder UI in ChartGenius
3. Pass symbol, qty, order type to `/v1/orders` endpoint
4. Return order confirmation with ID
5. Support stop-loss / take-profit orders
6. Track order status via WebSocket (if available)

**Brokers Supporting This:**
- ✅ Alpaca (best SDK support)
- ✅ Schwab (good documentation)
- ✅ Tradier (well-documented)
- ⚠️ E*TRADE (proprietary API)

**Timeline:** 3-4 weeks (includes testing, security review)

**Note:** This feature requires careful compliance review (see Section 4)

---

### 3.4 Alert Sync with Broker Orders
**Difficulty:** Medium  
**Prerequisites:** Webhook support or polling infrastructure

**Implementation Path:**
1. User sets price alert in ChartGenius (e.g., "notify if SPY > $450")
2. Alert triggers ChartGenius order placement
3. ChartGenius places order via broker API
4. Broker confirms order status
5. Sync status back to ChartGenius alerts dashboard

**Alternative: Broker-Native Alerts**
- Some brokers support alert APIs (Schwab, Tradier)
- Could create alerts directly on broker account
- Reduces infrastructure load on ChartGenius

**Brokers with Alert APIs:**
- Tradier: ✅ Native alert endpoint
- Schwab: ⚠️ Limited alert API
- Alpaca: ✅ Conditional order support

**Timeline:** 2-3 weeks

---

### 3.5 Portfolio Analytics
**Difficulty:** Medium-Hard  
**Prerequisites:** Full account data, historical data, multi-account support

**Possible Analytics:**
- Sector allocation (pie chart)
- Risk analysis (beta, correlation)
- Performance attribution (which trades drove returns)
- Tax-loss harvesting opportunities
- Dividend income tracking

**Data Requirements:**
- Current positions (symbol, shares, cost basis)
- Historical pricing for analysis
- Options positions (Greeks, margin impact)
- Cash flows (deposits, withdrawals)
- Dividends received

**Brokers with Best Analytics Support:**
- Interactive Brokers (most detailed data)
- Schwab (improving platform, good data)
- Alpaca (good API, needs custom analytics layer)

**Timeline:** 4-6 weeks (most complex feature)

---

## 4. REGULATORY & COMPLIANCE CONSIDERATIONS

### 4.1 Do We Need Broker-Dealer Registration?

**Short Answer:** Possibly, depends on scope of features.

**Analysis:**

**If ChartGenius ONLY provides read-only features:**
- ✅ NO broker-dealer registration needed
- Only act as information provider / analytics tool
- Users maintain full control of accounts at brokers

**If ChartGenius enables order placement (One-Click Trade):**
- ⚠️ GRAY AREA - Depends on implementation
- **Scenario 1:** User logs in, ChartGenius transmits pre-approved order
  - Likely: Not BD registration (user's broker executes)
  - ChartGenius = order routing tool
- **Scenario 2:** ChartGenius accumulates orders, executes in batches
  - Likely: **YES, BD registration required**
  - ChartGenius = acting as intermediary
- **Scenario 3:** ChartGenius acts on user's behalf without direct instruction
  - **DEFINITELY YES, BD registration + RIA registration required**
  - High legal risk

**Recommendation for MVP:**
- Keep order placement as "transmit-only" (user confirms each trade)
- Do NOT batch orders or execute on behalf of users
- Add explicit disclosure: "ChartGenius does not execute trades; orders are routed to [BROKER]"

---

### 4.2 SEC/FINRA Requirements for Trade Integration

**Key Regulations:**

| Regulation | Applies To | Requirement |
|-----------|-----------|------------|
| SEC Rule 10b5-1 | Algorithmic trading | Disclosure if ChartGenius runs auto-trading algorithms |
| SEC Rule 10b5-2 | Trading under plans | ChartGenius cannot control trading plan execution without written agreement |
| FINRA Rule 5210 | Anti-money laundering | Know-Your-Customer (KYC) compliance for trading activity |
| FINRA Rule 2010 | Standards of conduct | Suitability of recommendations if ChartGenius provides trading signals |
| SEC Rule 203A | Investment advice | If ChartGenius gives trading recommendations, may need RIA registration |

**For MVP (Read-Only + Manual Order Transmission):**
- ✅ No SEC registration needed
- ✅ No FINRA registration needed
- ⚠️ Still need AML/KYC monitoring if handling user data

**For Full Feature Set (Auto-Trading):**
- ❌ Likely requires SEC broker-dealer registration ($250K+ in capital)
- ❌ Likely requires FINRA membership ($50K+ in setup + annual fees)
- ❌ Requires RIA registration for advisory features ($150K+ legal + compliance)

---

### 4.3 Disclosure Requirements

**Required Disclosures (FINRA/SEC guidance):**

1. **Service Limitations**
   - "ChartGenius is a charting tool, not a broker or financial adviser"
   - "Orders are routed directly to [BROKER], which executes your trades"

2. **Conflict of Interest**
   - If ChartGenius monetizes order flow or receives rebates
   - Any revenue sharing with brokers

3. **Data Privacy**
   - How user data is stored and protected
   - Who has access to trading data
   - Retention policies for account/order information

4. **Trading Risks**
   - Market risk, execution risk, connectivity risk
   - Past performance ≠ future results
   - Leverage/margin risks if supported

5. **System Risk**
   - Latency disclosures (orders may not execute at displayed price)
   - Downtime risk (what happens if ChartGenius goes offline)
   - Third-party dependency (reliance on broker APIs)

---

### 4.4 Data Handling Rules

**Personal Financial Information (PFI) Protection:**

| Data Type | Handling Rules |
|-----------|---------------|
| Account credentials/API keys | Encrypt at rest, never log, rotate regularly |
| Positions & holdings | Treat as PFI, encrypt in database, access logs |
| Trade history | PFI, retain only as long as needed |
| Performance data | Can be anonymized for analytics |
| User behavior/alerts | Track for service improvement, anonymize if possible |

**Best Practices:**
- Use vault/secrets manager for API keys (never commit to code)
- Implement audit logging for all account data access
- SOC 2 Type II compliance recommended
- Data residency: Keep data in same region as broker (e.g., US brokers = US data centers)
- Liability insurance: Errors & Omissions (E&O) coverage recommended
